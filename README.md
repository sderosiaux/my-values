# My Values 🌟

A personal manifesto sharing the core values that guide meaningful collaboration and authentic relationships.

🌐 **[Read the full manifesto here](https://sderosiaux.github.io/my-values/)**

## What is this?

This is my personal declaration of values - the principles I strive to live by and the foundation for how I approach work, relationships, and life. By sharing these values openly, I hope to:

- Create deeper connections with like-minded individuals
- Foster more authentic and meaningful collaborations
- Build trust through transparency about what drives me
- Inspire others to reflect on and share their own values

## Core Values

### ⚡ **Urgency in Action**
We don't wait. We move. Momentum is everything. If it takes less than 5 minutes, we do it now. Work like it matters—because it does.

### 🎭 **Proactive Showmanship**
We don't ask for permission to create. We ask questions, try things, then show. Show, don't tell. Talk less, do more. Demos beat presentations.

### 🔥 **Energy + AI**
We lead with energy. We use AI in everything we do. Those who don't embrace both are already behind. Results first. Rewards follow.

## Why Share Values?

In a world of surface-level interactions, sharing our deeper values creates opportunities for:
- **Aligned Collaboration**: Work with people who share similar principles
- **Reduced Friction**: Clear expectations from the start
- **Meaningful Impact**: Focus energy on what truly matters
- **Authentic Relationships**: Connect beyond professional facades

## Join the Movement

Consider creating your own values manifesto. When we openly share what drives us, we create space for more meaningful connections and purposeful collaboration.
