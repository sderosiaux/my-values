# My Values 🌟

A personal manifesto sharing the core values that guide meaningful collaboration and authentic relationships.

🌐 **[Read the full manifesto here](https://sderosiaux.github.io/my-values/)**

## What is this?

This is my personal declaration of values - the principles that drive me every day and the foundation for how I approach work, relationships, and life. These are the values I embody and encourage everyone working with me at Conduktor to adopt.

## Core Values

### ⚡ **Urgency in Action**
We don't wait. We move. Momentum is everything. If it takes less than 5 minutes, we do it now. Work like it matters—because it does.

### 🎭 **Proactive Showmanship**
We don't ask for permission to create. We ask questions, try things, then show. Show, don't tell. Talk less, do more. Demos beat presentations.

### 🔥 **Energy + AI**
We lead with energy. We use AI in everything we do. Those who don't embrace both are already behind. Results first. Rewards follow.

## Join the Movement

Consider creating your own values manifesto. When we openly share what drives us, we create space for more meaningful connections and purposeful collaboration.
